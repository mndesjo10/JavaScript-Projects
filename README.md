# JavaScript Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository!

This repository contains all the coding projects I complete throughout my JavaScript course. I will regularly update it with assignments, exercises, and examples, making it a portfolio of my progress and skills. Keeping my code here helps me organize my work and demonstrates my proficiency with GitHubâ€”a valuable asset for any developer.

I will continue to add new projects and update this repository as I learn and grow.
